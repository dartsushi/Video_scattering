The gif version of the scattering process in our paper:
“[Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defect](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.26780)”


### One-dimensional scattering processes.

### Two-dimensional scattering process.

From the transverse-field ising model at $g=6$ to a topological phase. The bottom panel measures the product of $X$ along the circumference of the cylinder.
