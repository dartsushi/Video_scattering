### Two-dimensional scattering process.

From the transverse-field ising model at $g=6$ to a topological phase. The bottom panel measures the product of $X$ along the circumference of the cylinder.

$$H_L = -\sum_{i,j} Z_iZ_j -g\sum_{i}X_i,$$ 
$$H_R = -\sum_{i} Z_i -g\sum_{v}A_v,$$ 
$$H_{im} = -\sum_y Z_{(I-1,y)} Z_{(I,y)} Z_{(I+1,y)},$$
where $A_v$ is a product of four $X$ touching the vertex $v$.
